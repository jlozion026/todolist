# To Do List

This project has basic function like adding task list. Displaying the task name, when it was created and a check box to indicate that the task is done. You can also update the task list created and you can also delte the task once done.



## Creating the Database and Table

You have .

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salary INT(10) NOT NULL
);
```
